SolveDSGE
=========

SolveDSGE is a Julia package for solving Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models.  The package is aimed at macroeconomists interested in perturbation-based and projection-based solutions to their nonlinear general equilibrium models.  SolveDSGE offers a broad array of solution methods that can be applied inter-changeably, allowing one solution to form the initialization for another.

To solve a model using SolveDSGE two files are required.  The model file contains the specifications, parameters, equations, etc for the model that is to be solved.  The solution file reads and processes the model file, specifies a solution scheme, solves the model, and performs any post-solution analysis.

If you use this package, then please star the package on github and acknowledge its use appropriately in your work.

Installation
------------

You can install SolveDSGE by typing in REPL

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("SolveDSGE")
```

SolveDSGE is supported by several other packages: NLsolve, ForwardDiff, GaussQuadrature, ChebyshevApprox, SmolyakApprox, and PiecewiseLinearApprox.

Perturbation methods
--------------------

SolveDSGE allows rational expectations equilibria to be computed using first-, second-, and third-order perturbation methods.

Projection methods
------------------

SolveDSGE can also solve DSGE models using projection methods that are based on Chebyshev polynomials, Smolyak polynomials, and piecewise linear approximation.

Further information
-------------------
This version (version 0.4.x) represents an important update on version 0.3, which didn't allow any form of parallization.  In the current version, at the user's discretion, models can be solved using multi-threaded projection methods.  This version also removes support for the optimal policy routines that were present in version 0.2.  At some point in the future, SolveDSGE's approach to solving and analyzing optimal policy is likely to be reintroduced based on the model-file/solution-file framework.

Examples of how to use SolveDSGE to solve a model are contained in the examples folder.  At the moment there are three examples: two stochastic models and one deterministic model.  The example models are intended to be familiar, easy to follow, and easy to replicate.

Although it no-doubt requires much improvement, there is a User Guide that describes in detail the steps that should be taken to solve a model, and documents the relevant functions, solution schemes, and solution structures.  How to simulate data from a solved model, compute impulse response functions, and approximate PDFs and CDFs is also described.
